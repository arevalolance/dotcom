Hey there,

You may be curious about who the creator of this website is. Well, let's begin by introducing myself. I'm Lance, born in the Philippines, and I'm a software developer. I've always wanted to build my website and write about things I learn from time to time.

> Well, what took you so long?

For the past year, the fear of judgment has kept me from building this website. However, when I saw this [post](https://aliabdaal.com/book-journey/the-no-one-cares-mindset/) from Ali Abdaal a few months ago, it made me think, why should I care? Well, the answer is simple, I shouldn't. So here we are with a working site. Welcome!

#### **What do I do?**

As of today, I'm a senior in B.S. Computer Science. I am interested in web development, both the frontend and backend side of things. Soon, I would love to explore more outside my comfort zone. Outside of work, I love watching movies and listening to music.

#### **What to expect?**

On this website, you'll see and read about my journey toward becoming a _"great"_ developer. Here, I'll write various essays, tutorials, snippets, and other stuff that goes through my mind each month/week/day.

#### **What's next?**

For now, bookmark my website or subscribe to my [RSS Feed](https://arevalolance.com/feed.xml) to get the latest updates. Soon, I'll be adding a subscribe feature for mail. If you have any questions, email me at [hi@arevalolance.com](mailto:hi@arevalolance.com).

See you soon!

Lance
