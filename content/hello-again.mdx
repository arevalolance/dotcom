Hey there,

What you're seeing now is the third iteration of my personal website. It has now evolved from a simple one-page resume viewer to now this, a place for my thoughts. Before everything else, let me re-introduce myself.

Hi, I'm Lance.

## What do I do?

I'm a Software Engineer who likes to build fun things on the Internet. As of now, I'm focusing on finding my _real_ interests when it comes to development. Is it front end? Maybe backend? Who knows? There are a lot of things I'd like to explore.

> If you're interested in working with me, I still do both. Let's chat if you want to learn more about my skills at [hi@arevalolance.com](mailto:hi@arevalolance.com).

## What to expect?

I used to think I should focus on revolving my life around tech. You know, become one of those people called a [_10x developer_](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/31673/10x-developer). Well, focusing on one thing in life isn't fun. I don't want to burn myself out. So, this time, I'll try to explore other things I find fun.

Furthermore, here are the things I hope to do in the next few days/months/years:

- Start a YouTube Channel
- Start a Bi-weekly/Monthly Newsletter
- Build my own game
- Run my own SaaS
- Become an Indie Hacker

If you want to learn how I'll build whatever I choose to focus on in the future, feel free to visit again soon.

## What's next?

For now, bookmark my website or subscribe to my [RSS Feed](https://arevalolance.com/feed.xml) to get the latest updates. Soon, I hope to post more about things I find interesting to share with you. If you have any questions, email me, and let's chat at [hi@arevalolance.com](mailto:hi@arevalolance.com).

Have a nice day!

Lance
